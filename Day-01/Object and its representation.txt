Object and its representation:

     An object in JavaScript is a data type that can store various collections of 
data and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() 
constructor or the object initializer / literal syntax.
const object = { a: 'foo', b: 42, c: {} };

In JavaScript, objects are defined as an unordered collection of related data, of 
primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be 
variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the 
context of an object.

The representation of an object in JavaScript is a string of [object Object]. To see 
the contents of an object, you should print the object to the console using 
console.log() or convert the object to a string. Alternatively, you can use a for…in 
loop to iterate over the object and see its contents
