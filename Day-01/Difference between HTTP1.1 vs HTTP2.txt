Difference between http/2 and http/1.1

	HTTP/2 is the successor of HTTP/1.1 and was released in 2015. The 
main difference between HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 is that HTTP/2 is a binary 
protocol, whereas HTTP/1.1 is a text-based protocol. This means that 
HTTP/2 is more efficient in terms of data transfer, as it can compress 
headers and multiplex multiple requests over a single connection. HTTP/2 
also supports server push, which allows the server to send resources to the 
client before the client requests them.

HTTP/1.1, on the other hand, requires a new connection for each 
request/response cycle, which can be inefficient. It also lacks support for 
server push and header compression.

In HTTP/1.1, the client sends a request to the server, and the server responds 
with the requested resource. This process is repeated for each resource that 
the client needs to load, which can lead to high latency and slow page load 
times. In contrast, HTTP/2 uses a single connection to send multiple requests 
and responses simultaneously, which can significantly reduce latency and 
improve page load times.

Another key difference between HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 is that HTTP/2 uses 
stream prioritization to optimize the order in which resources are loaded. 
This means that the most important resources are loaded first, which can 
further improve page load times.

In summary, HTTP/2 is a more efficient and faster protocol than HTTP/1.1, 
due to its binary format, header compression, multiplexing, server push, and 
stream prioritization features
