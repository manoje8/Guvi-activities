Difference between window, screen, and document in JavaScript


*	Window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, 
and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can 
access it as window. Window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser 
and has properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, etc. Window 
also has a screen object and a document object as its properties.


*	Document is the content of the window, i.e. the HTML document. You can 
access it as window.document or just document. Document is where the DOM 
(document object model) is and has properties like title, URL, cookie, etc. 
Document also has methods to manipulate the DOM, such as getElementById, 
createElement, appendChild, etc.


*	Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions. You can 
access it as window.screen or just screen. Screen has properties like width, 
height, availWidth, availHeight, etc. Screen does not have any methods and is 
not related to the actual browser window size.


The most basic relationship among the three is that each browser tab has its own 
window, and a window has window.document and window.screen properties. The 
browser tab's window is the global context, so document and screen refer to 
window.document and window.screen.
