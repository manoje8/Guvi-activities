Difference between document and window objects:

The window object is the global object that contains all the properties and methods 
available to the current window or frame. The document object is a property of the 
window object that represents the DOM (document object model) of the current 
web page.

The document object represents a web page that is loaded in the browser. By 
accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With 
the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The 
document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.

The window object represents the browser window. It can be used to manipulate 
the browser window, such as opening a new window, resizing the window, or 
navigating to a new page. The window object can be accessed with the keyword 
window.

In summary, the window object is the top-level object in the browser’s JavaScript 
hierarchy, while the document object is a property of the window object that 
represents the DOM of the current web page.

Here is a blog post that explains the difference between the document object and 
the window object in detail:

The window object is the top-level object in the browser’s JavaScript hierarchy, 
while the document object is a property of the window object that represents the 
DOM of the current web page. The window object is used to manipulate the 
browser window, while the document object is used to manipulate the content of 
the web page.

In summary, the window object and the document object are two different objects 
in JavaScript that serve different purposes. The window object represents the 
browser window, while the document object represents the DOM of the current 
web page. Understanding the difference between these two objects is essential for 
developing web applications that are dynamic and interactive
