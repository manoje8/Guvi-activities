Difference between document and window objects:

     The window object is the global object that contains all the properties 
and methods available to the current window or frame. 
     The document object is a property of the window object that represents 
the DOM (document object model) of the current web page.
 
The document object represents a web page that is loaded in the 
browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element 
in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add 
dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed 
with a window.document or just document.
 
The window object represents the browser window. It can be used to 
manipulate the browser window, such as opening a new window, 
resizing the window, or navigating to a new page. The window object 
can be accessed with the keyword window.
 
In summary, the window object is the top-level object in the browser’s 
JavaScript hierarchy, while the document object is a property of the 
window object that represents the DOM of the current web page.
